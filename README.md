# Final-Year-Project
The aim of this project was to detect microbial contamination of drinking water at low concentrations using CO2 respirated from the microorganims.

Visual plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was to determine Microbial contamination
timin.mat and aveBL.mat timeseries are necessary to run all the code. They represent the baseline and the time, respectively.

The folders R1 onwards represent the testing conditions (concentration and microbial culture) further detail can be provided on request as well as additional testing conditions.
