# Final-Year-Project

Titled: “ Automation and evaluation of a newly developed Carbon dioxide Evolution Monitoring System (CEMS)”. The aim was to detect the presence of microorganisms by measuring the carbon dioxide they respire and determine the time taken for the detection.
The project consisted of:

•	Designing and building a rig that automatically loaded a vessel with a predetermined amount of water and air using electronic components and an ESP32 module. 
•	Working in the lab culturing, plating and inoculating both E.coli and mixed river water cultures at different, low concentrations. 
•	Conducting lab based tests to quantify the baseline followed by tests to acquire the time taken for detection. 
•	Determining the best time detection method using the statistical testing and visual identification in MATLAB. 


Visual plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was to determine Microbial contamination
timin.mat and aveBL.mat timeseries are necessary to run all the code. They represent the baseline and the time, respectively.

The folders R1 onwards represent the testing conditions (concentration and microbial culture) further detail can be provided on request as well as additional testing conditions.
